# A simple navigation tool!

In this module, we'll create a mobile map showing the user's GPS position and heading. The purpose of this example is to show how to integrate OpenLayers with browser APIs and 3rd party utilities.

With just a few lines of code, we'll be taking advantage of the browser's Geolocation API to get the GPS position, and the [kompas](https://npmjs.com/package/kompas) utility to get the heading from the device's gyroscope. Using a vector layer, we can easily display the results on a map.
