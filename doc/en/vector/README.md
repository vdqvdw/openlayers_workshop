# Let's make a feature editor!

In this module, we'll create a basic editor for working with vector data.  Our goal is to make it so a user can import data, draw new features, modify existing features, and export the result.  We'll be working with [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/) data in this module, but OpenLayers supports a broad range of vector formats if you're interested in working with other sources.
